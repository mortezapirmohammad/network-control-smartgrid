# network-control-smartgrid
In this repository, A smart-grid is working in islanded mode and 2 DG units supply the AC unknown dynamic load. DG units consist of PV panels and ESSs and sliding mode controllers are considered to regulate load voltage and guarantee accurate power sharing among DGs. SimpowerSystems and True-time2.0 toolboxes have been used in Simulink/MATLAB.
